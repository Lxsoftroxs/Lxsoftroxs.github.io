Liquid seeping out of the hands I call tools, shaking and stuttering they were made for destruction, I see the rust corrode my ornamental knife from the appreciation of my slimy hands. Cursed to describe faults in the details, the precise things in my life breakdown because my hands can't keep them together. Hands made for destruction
