I sat across from him, as we both carried backpacks from our worlds apart. I knew I couldn't speak his language but I was so curious as to what he knew. After long days the seats on the train were a moment of respite, a way to progress while resting. So as the effects of the day settled throughout the mind and body, his eyes began to droop. However, a curiosity between the both of us kept our eyes interlocked. What was the other thinking and why were they so persistent about looking into my eyes. I will never know what was on his mind but I wanted to know. I began writing in a journal to show him something that maybe he would understand. Students share the common language of math, units may change but numbers are universal. I began to compose equations, simple but progressing in difficulty. Not much can be learned from sharing solved equations but I craved anything, so I persisted in light of wanting to know by the age I assumed he was, what his math level would. I curse myself for never handing him the journal to speak back to me, and yet I think he deserved his sleep.
