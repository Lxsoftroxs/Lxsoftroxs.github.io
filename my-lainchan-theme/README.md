# My Lainchan Theme

This is a custom Jekyll theme inspired by the Lainchan aesthetic—a dark, minimalist design with neon accents.

## File Structure

- `_config.yml`: Site configuration and theme defaults.
- `_includes/header.html`: Header snippet with site title and navigation.
- `_includes/footer.html`: Footer snippet.
- `_layouts/default.html`: Main layout that includes header, content, and footer.
- `_layouts/post.html`: Layout for blog posts.
- `_layouts/page.html`: Layout for static pages.
- `assets/css/style.css`: Main stylesheet with Lainchan-inspired styles.

## Usage

1. **Option A: Directly in Your Jekyll Site**  
   Copy the files (or merge them into your site’s corresponding folders) and update your site’s `_config.yml` to set:
   ```yaml
   title: "Your Site Title"
   description: "Your site description."
