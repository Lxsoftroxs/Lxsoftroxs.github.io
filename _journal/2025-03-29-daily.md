What happened on this crazy day, well as this is my first entree I wanna kinda highlight what I want this to be. I spent several hours yesterday walking for several hours in the cold rain thinking about who I could talk to. An issue I had with my previous girlfriend is that I would censor many parts of my stories to better fit what I wanted her to know. Sometimes she would get more of the full story and get angry at me for not telling the whole truth. I think similar to the concept of masks, we only show parts of the whole that we are. I restrict the story I tell because I honestly find many of my thoughts and actions to be stupid or gross. Like no one knew my location after I was kicked out of my friends apartment, the closest person I know thought I was in a hotel and everyone else still thought I was with my friend in his dorm. In reality I wandered the streets and sat people watching inside libraries. Everyone in my life would think that to be illadvised so I keep the full story to myself. When I make stupid choices and don't tell anyone its a gamble that it won't affect anyone else. Only when it grows out of my control does it hurt others. 

Now with that said I realise the stupidity of it all, it wouldn't get out of my control if I informed others and got help. However, I haven't matured to that point yet. This is one of my steps towards that growth, I want to say more of what I do throughout my day and let the world have access to it. It could limit me, if an everpresisent sense of being watched exists then people tend to do less, but it could also keep me more accountable. 

Also I felt like the posts became more tpic orientated rather then just a journal of sorts. Hopefully they don't interact poorly where I forgot one or the other. This way I am able to just ramble a little more without as much content awareness and image to keep up. 

Okay with that out of the way what interesting things have happened today. About 10 minutes ago I shared a much larger section of the story of my New York trip to a friend. It was freeing because I was able to share more of what I felt versus what I felt I should feel. I think I've spent so much time thinking about improving and being better for people that I've neutered my sense of self. I remember even asking my last girlfriend what I should say to convince her to date me, she replied of course, "It doesn't matter what I want to hear, its the person you actually are that I want to hear about" (paraphrased). A flaw with that ideal is there is already an image of who they think I am in their head and I tend to want to fullfill that, making them think I'm being "real". 

The reality of my emotions is that I want to collapse on the floor and cry out, to puke and bask in my sadness. Who the fuck wants to actually walk around in the cold while wet, who wants to sleep on a fucking chair for 3 nights straight. Fucking no one but here I sit trying to stay productive even though its the last thing I want to do. 

I've journalled several times throughout my life. The original is a small book I keep in my room. (Notes on that later). I also kept a digital journal through my first major relationship in highschool for 3 months. A lot of the time it was just a recounting of events. Similarly I am trying to restart the journalling process because I fell my memory slipping. Even on this trip I just went on there are few photos I took and so I strin to piece together every event and I want to hold the good closely to my heart so that I can remember this trip fondly. So I guess heres my best recounting of events from start to finish in the most detail possible, mostly just for me. I also dont really wanna include names or minor personal details but I also want this to be very faithful, im activly considering as I type this what I should do. Maybe just the reddit thing where I give fake names sure. 

Okay Becca lets call her. The night mostly begins with my misinterpretation of a text. She said she'd arrive in New York by 2am, believing this to mean that she would be at the hotel we agreed upon by that time. Having already struggled to find the sort of hole in the wall that the hotel was, I made sure to stand out on the street and watch for her to make sure she saw where to go. I made sure to go inside and tell the desk attendant that I was just waiting on a friend, eventually I realized she meant she would enter New York by 2am and she made it to the hotel by maybe 2:45, I don't clearly remember. In that time I tried my best to stay warm and the desk attendant came outside several times to encourage me inside to wait but I refused. I stood next to a couple smoking weed for most of the time. Arriving fianlly she stepped out of an uber and immediatly fell because she got her bag stuck on the seatbelt. Giggling to myself we exchanged greetings. (Im gonna attempt dialouge maybe its not gonna be exact of course im not perfect) 
"You didn't see anything" she said 
"No of course not, great first impression though" i replied 
"Its been so many years since we've seen each other", "agreed"
We proceeded indoors and I lead her up the elevator to the attendant. Helping her check in I realize shes pretty sick and tired. We dealt with some issues with the insurrance fee or whatever they call it being over priced, and how late we were checking in but it only took them a couple minutes to help set up our room. She proceeded to get the money into her account, I attempted to pay it but she rejected my advances towards the terminal. This gave me an interesting first understanding of how she felt about money and her friends. Eventually it goes through and she stumbles into the lounge as I get the room key and the rest of the information. I sit down with her and she begins to talk about how she hasn't felt that light headed before. Quickly I'm starting to realise she hasn't eaten much and the travel was very draining alongside her throat sickness. Taking things slow I encourage us up to the room after we talk for a bit, I don't remember what about but I do know we talked. After entering the room I remember she comments on the lack of ammenties like a microwave or coffee maker. She then collapes onto the bed. Making me keep the lights off I also learn that she hates any lights being on or blinds beign raised. Having to adapate to being in a dark room for the rest of the trip I sit on the bed side as she lies there. The original plan was for me to sleep on the ground, I did not think that was nesscary as the bed was pretty large. Without discussing it I just ended up sleeping in the same bed as her. Laying there with her we began talking more about the old stories and people from our childhood. This went on till I think around 5am and I got ready for bed sharing some melatonin with her because I knew at least I wouldn't be able to sleep because I felt so energized by her pressence. Getting very minimal sleep I mostly just rolled around and honestly tried getting closer to her as earlier as we talked shed bring her face so close to mine in the bed. Several times through the night she would shift and look over at me but I sleep so lightly so whenever she moved I'd glace at her direction and we'd meet eyes for a moment. With the morning for us rolling around I think at that point I began to get up and attempt getting her to start getting ready so we could have our days out on the town. The plan was always that I would maybe stay half a day with her but sasthings progressed it changed. She refused to move and wanted to sleep the day away, I ended up going out in the morning to get her some medicine for her throat and a snack and drink as well, she is a very picky person so the choice of cheezits were not in her favor leaving them to me. I'm not exactly sure what sparked the next step but we did begin to cuddle and I resigned to stay in bed with her for the day. By dinner time both of us became hungry enough to get ourselves together and go out to a local Japenese market, it was close enough we decided to walk. Following her around I wanted to let her experience the joy of trying to navigate and plan in such a grand city, after several loop backs we ended up at the market and began to shop. 

Man halfway through this and I don't feel like finishing it, although itll help retain the memory I feel like by putting it into words its compressing down the emotion and experience. Like none of this really exxplains the tension and my eventual sinking comfort into her. I loved spending the time with her even though none of it really went as planned. I was just happy that she was there with me. I'm going to continue but in less detail just for myself. 
We took a lift back and looked over our food at the hotel, we forgot uttensials so she peeled a dragon fruit for the first time and I ate pork katsu with my hands. It was like a little picnic on the floor as we shared little foods. She loves all her fruits and introduced me to mini kiwis which I didnt know existed. I think at this point I tried to setup the tv but it sucked too. So we went to my laptop. She recommended the move Happiness, as we watched a line stuck out to me "I'm not shit, I'm champaign". We laughed and joked as it went, eventually pausing it as things became more intimate. Then the night progressed into a new day
The next morning she had more energy and got up a bit earlier. I left to get bagels for us, she wanted an Asiago with butter. I walked through the rain and got my first experience alone back in New York, very pleasant morning. We at ravishouly and then settled back into bed. We stayed ther for quite awhile and grew more intimate again. Afterwards it was eveningish and she was sparking with energy. We got going and took a train to the book store and grocery store. I did miss a stop on the way but it gave her more time to tell stories of her earlier childhood as we walked. Entering the bookstore the layout hadn't changed at all since my last visit and we explored all the books, she foudn the cook books and childbooks interesting, making fun of my nose on the way as well as discussing buying the new diary of the wimpy kid. I saw a lot of manga I wanted but we then decnded to the pens and paper, she liked the masks on the wall and wanted one, we also walked through some cute plushes. Leaving there we entered the grocery store which to me was the highlight of the trip. I followed her around as I listened to her stories and as we planned how and when we would hangout next in California. Seeing all the food with a new perspective by my side I was enthrauled. After we snuggled for the first time I would kiss her forhead at any oppurtunity and several times through the grocery store I did. Then she got a smoothie and we headed out. Needing to return our new goodies we took the train back and dropped off everything. I felt the need to sink back into bed with her but she still was full of energy and had us go back out to see an urban outfitters that was very large. She bought a candle and a new dress. We then sought out a lighter at a local target, getting to really J walk on the way there. With this stuff in hand we then took a long trip to conney island to see if we could ride a ferris wheel. Sadly it was closed and the area was kinda sketchy but we made the most of it by exploring the beach and a little park. She tried to convince me several times to break into an icecream parlor that was closed. On the way back we had some deeper talks about family and relationships. I enjoyed hodling her hand and listening to her while seeing the city lights pass by. Arriving back to the hotel it was pretty late but we ended up putting on All Hallows Eve, the type of movies shes into are much darker then I'm used to so I was honestly scared of what would show but I found the movie pretty comediac. She got a bit spooked and wanted me to stand by the bathroom. We then stopped this movie half way through too. She was on her period at this point. We headed to sleep from there. Waking up she was in the bathroom and she said she was feeling pretty sick. Unknowingly she was vomitting and suffering pretty badly. When I noticed I went out to get her some better stuff to help with the pain and I went further to get higher quality stuff. Eventually she made it out fine but we had to start getting ready to split as we started heading towards the bus location. It was windy and we were hungry so we stumbled into a starbucks, she gets a grey tea while shes there. We get to the bus location a bit early so we sit and talk on soe steps for awhile. I enjoyed it so much. As we proceed to part ways she stops me, brings me close and tells me she loves me and misses me, we kiss then seperate. 
Man thats so sad since we arent even talking a day after that but a man can hope that there was worth behind those days. Hoping she'll remember like I am and think to talk to me again. But I have a flight to catch. You could be reading this there is a chance since I gave you access but all I can say is sorry, someday I hope to see you again to try again.
