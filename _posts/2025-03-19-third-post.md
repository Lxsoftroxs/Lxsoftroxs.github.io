Where is it?

The birth of the interweb, a truly monumental moment of interconnectivity that has nearly reached every corner of the world in modern day. Such a complex web of connections, it grows and shrinks, forming new connections like a brain, from some perspectivies it could be considered alive. However, something needs to feed this creature, as humans add and remix we get a system of production and sharing. I wanted to know where the heart of this beast was and is. A clearer picture is formed looking through the history of the internet. We see message boards and forums gather people based on interests. The largest being 4chan, we would witness its creation of content and its spread through the other social media platforms. Memes and the details of peoples lives with their ideals smeared across the screen, we had a beating heart and all the limbs that would connect the dfferent generations and types of people. In modern day these messages boards have died off as those who grew up with it grew out of it. Seeing Gen Alphas current hold on the creation of content the platform has shifted. No longer held in such a free and unsensored place many of the platforms hold mostly isolated sub groups of the internet moved by algorithms. Like an octopus, has the internet grown to a state of needing many hearts? As shortform has culminated into the new media format after the video format rose past message boards, theres been a shift into a creator based representation. Like the democracy of a nation, its grown too large for every person to vote on every decision. So we pick our leaders, who we believe to embody our ideals. Similarly the creators we support online now embody our voice. The rise in parasocial relationships can be linked towards increased loneliness due to the descructive nature of social media; however, it can also be connected to our need for representation. We no longer can be heard screaming out to the void, so we put our energy behind our community so someone can voice our needs. So my hypothesis for the current heart of the internet is not a platform, rather its a group of those who are watched. We are all no longer creators, we serve the larger machine known as the internet and those who feed it. 

Recently I've been attempting to do more Biphasic sleep. I usually sleep so light because I have several friends in different time zones and I like to be avaliable at all times. In making this less straining on me I've wanted to split up my sleep into long naps and use the offset to capitalize on it being less busy late or early in the morning. Makes being productive easier; however, it is disruptive to those around me. 

Building back up my writing chops I've started thinking back to my college essays and how far I've come since writing them. Its regrettable that I've been freed from my depression only recently; however, it does give me hope that with our without school I am self motivated enough to grow and learn on my own.
